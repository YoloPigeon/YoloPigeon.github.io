About:
Date 1: 2008-2014
Title 1: The Beginning
Text 1: We are a group of mostly homeschooled students in Auckland, New Zealand, who are enthusiastic about the fields of science, engineering, and robotics. We believe that in working as a team we can achieve great results.
We have been competing in the VEX Robotics Competition since it first came to New Zealand in 2008. In our first year, we were the World Programming Skills Champions, and then the following year we were World Tournament Champions. Back over here, we have been National Tournament Champions four times, National Design Award Champions twice, and we have also been National Excellence Award winners, the greatest award presented at a competition.  Each year we have qualified and been fortunate enough to travel to America to compete in the World Championships up till 2014 
We work as a team to develop multiple robots and we believe this is the key to success.
